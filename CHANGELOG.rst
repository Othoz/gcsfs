Unreleased
----------


0.4.0 - 11.12.2018
------------------

Added
'''''
- Implemented the ``create`` property on ``GCSFS`` and the corresponding opener. By default all new GCSFS instances have ``create=False`` (PyFilesystem default)
    which means they will raise a ``CreateFailed`` exception if ``root_path`` does not exist



0.3.0 - 20.11.2018
------------------

Added
'''''
- This is the first release available on `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__

Removed
'''''''
- ``delimiter`` property from ``GCSFS`` as it was not fully functional and we currently do not have any use case for it

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.listdir()`` and ``GCSFS.scandir()`` now also correctly list blobs on the root level of a bucket


0.2.0 - 09.11.2018
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- Open-sourced GCSFS by moving it to GitHub
- ``GCSFS.getinfo()`` does not magically fix missing directory markers anymore.
  Instead, there is a new method ``GCSFS.fix_storage()`` which can be explicitly called to check and fix the entire filesystem.

Removed
'''''''
- ``project`` and ``credentials`` properties from ``GCSFS``. Instead, one can now optionally pass a ``client`` of type
  `google.cloud.storage.Client <https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/storage/client.html#module-google.cloud.storage.client>`__.

0.1.6 - 30.10.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.makedirs()`` is now suitable for multiprocessing


0.1.5 - 08.10.2018
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- The ``bucket`` and ``client`` properties of ``GCSFS`` are now only computed once on instance initialization (performance improvement)


0.1.4 - 08.10.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.exists()`` now correctly handles existing directories that are not marked with an empty file


0.1.3 - 04.10.2018
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- Added a custom implementation of ``FS.opendir()`` in order to be able to skip the directory check if strict=False (performance improvement)


0.1.2 - 20.09.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- Fixed a bug where ``listdir``/``scandir`` on the root level of a bucket would always return an empty result
