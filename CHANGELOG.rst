All release versions should be documented here with release date and types of changes.
Unreleased changes and pre-releases (i.e. alpha/beta versions) can be documented under the section `Unreleased`.

Possible types of changes are:

- `Added` for new features

- `Removed` for now removed features
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities


Unreleased
----------

Added
'''''
- Experimental: Clients now automatically retry GCS requests that return with "503 Service Unavailable" or "504 Gateway Timeout.

Fixed
'''''
- Some tests were still calling ``get_bucket()`` from the constructor of ``GCSFS``.


1.3.0 - 20.05.2020
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- Removed the (non-required) call to ``get_bucket()`` from the constructor of ``GCSFS``. This avoids the need for storage.buckets.get permissions on that bucket and thus now allows users to simplify access management by using tight, predefined IAM roles.
  This change has two implications: a) the constructor is now a bit faster as one less RPC is performed; b) the error message in case a bucket does not exist is slightly less informative.

1.2.0 - 01.04.2020
------------------

Added
'''''
- ``open_fs`` now supports providing a custom "project" and "api_endpoint", e.g. ``open_fs("gs://bucket_name?project=test")`` or ``open_fs("gs://bucket_name?api_endpoint=http%3A//localhost%3A8888")`` (#26)


1.1.0 - 07.01.2020
------------------

Added
'''''
- ``GCSFS.get_mapper()`` which returns a ``GCSMap`` that wraps a ``GCSFS`` as a ``MutableMapping``.
  The keys of the mapping become files and the values (which must be bytes) the contents of those files.
  This is particularly useful to be used with libraries such as `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/>`_ or `zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/>`_. (#21)

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.fix_storage()`` no longer creates a directory marker if ``root_path`` is the actual root of the bucket.
  Apart from not having any advantage, this caused subsequent ``GCSFS.fix_storage()`` calls as well as ``GCSFS.walk()`` to be stuck in endless loops. (#19)


1.0.0 - 27.08.2019
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- Instead of uploading all blobs as *application/octet-stream*, the MIME type is now guessed via ``mimetypes.guess_type()``.
  This enables e.g. hotlinking images directly from GCS. (#15)


0.4.2 - 30.07.2019
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- Fixed a bug where the url parameter ``strict`` was not considered by GCSFS, e.g. in ``open_fs("gs://bucket_name?strict=False")`` (#11)


0.4.1 - 18.12.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- Fixed a bug where ``create=True`` in combination with an empty-ish ``root_path`` like ``""``, ``"."`` or ``"/"`` would create a directory marker.


0.4.0 - 11.12.2018
------------------

Added
'''''
- Implemented the ``create`` property on ``GCSFS`` and the corresponding opener. By default all new GCSFS instances have ``create=False`` (PyFilesystem default)
    which means they will raise a ``CreateFailed`` exception if ``root_path`` does not exist (#8)


0.3.0 - 20.11.2018
------------------

Added
'''''
- This is the first release available on `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__

Removed
'''''''
- ``delimiter`` property from ``GCSFS`` as it was not fully functional and we currently do not have any use case for it

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.listdir()`` and ``GCSFS.scandir()`` now also correctly list blobs on the root level of a bucket


0.2.0 - 09.11.2018
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- Open-sourced GCSFS by moving it to GitHub
- ``GCSFS.getinfo()`` does not magically fix missing directory markers anymore.
  Instead, there is a new method ``GCSFS.fix_storage()`` which can be explicitly called to check and fix the entire filesystem.

Removed
'''''''
- ``project`` and ``credentials`` properties from ``GCSFS``. Instead, one can now optionally pass a ``client`` of type
  `google.cloud.storage.Client <https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/storage/client.html#module-google.cloud.storage.client>`__.

0.1.6 - 30.10.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.makedirs()`` is now suitable for multiprocessing


0.1.5 - 08.10.2018
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- The ``bucket`` and ``client`` properties of ``GCSFS`` are now only computed once on instance initialization (performance improvement)


0.1.4 - 08.10.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- ``GCSFS.exists()`` now correctly handles existing directories that are not marked with an empty file


0.1.3 - 04.10.2018
------------------

Changed
'''''''
- Added a custom implementation of ``FS.opendir()`` in order to be able to skip the directory check if strict=False (performance improvement)


0.1.2 - 20.09.2018
------------------

Fixed
'''''
- Fixed a bug where ``listdir``/``scandir`` on the root level of a bucket would always return an empty result
